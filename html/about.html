		HELLO! <br />
	</p>
	 <p>
		Somehow, you've found yourself on a page dedicated to learning all about me. Leonard, aka BrokenSyntax.<br />
		Just by finding yourself here, I can assume with a degree of certainty,  that you're aware of my enthusiasm for all things computer.<br />
		I do enjoy a lot of activities a)way from the keyboard as well. Lately that includes LARP, cycling, FMA, and rock climbing. <br />
