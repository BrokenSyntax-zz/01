	<p> I've had a habit over the years of documenting very little, and none of that online. This changes now.<br />
	I'll try to keep things organized, but this will have a litter of solutions and information collected and built for all kinds of reasons.<br />
	If you're going to stumble on some forgotten hard-coded password/login info, good luck. Some time ago I started keeping test logins suited in a separate document and polling it into variables. This makes it easy to update passwords for a number of testing scenarios at one, as well as ensuring they don't get uploaded with the commit, lost in comment code, or left carelessly in a ~bak file.<br />
Sorry (not sorry) to disappoint. $pwd and $user will just have to be set with your own environment's information.<br />
