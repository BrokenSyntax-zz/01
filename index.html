	I'm not your average web master. Probably because I'm still not sure I've mastered anything, ever.<br />
	That doesn't mean I'm a failure at code however. I enjoy automating tasks and scripting. I even used to own a Geocities site! Amazing right?
	<p>
	Now it's time to get back on track.<br />
	Host my toys online. Learn to use my GitHub account. Maybe even tackle some requests on my favourite FOSS projects.<br />
	I'll try to keep this from being a dumping ground of lost and broken tools.<br />
	It will probably be forever simplistic.<br />
